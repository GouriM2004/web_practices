# Expense Splitter (OOP PHP)

## Setup
1. Create a MySQL database and import `sql/expense_splitter.sql`.
2. Update DB credentials in `includes/Config.php` if needed.
3. Copy project to your web server root (e.g., htdocs or www).
4. Open `http://localhost/Expense_Splitter_OOP/index.php`

## Notes
- Uses procedural MySQLi with OOP PHP classes.
- For production, use HTTPS, CSRF tokens, and stronger validation.
